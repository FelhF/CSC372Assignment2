   <h1>My trip to Paris was <em>GREAT!</em></h1>
</head>
<body>
    
    <p>Last month I went on a trip to Paris and it may be the <b>BEST</b> country I've traveled to as of yet!
    It was such a special place that I don't know where to start discussing my trip there.

Usually when people think about Paris they think about places like the Eiffel Tower. Of course, for anyone visiting Paris, the Eiffel tower is a must. 
However, do not overlook all other things that Paris has to offer.
</p>
<p> <div3>My recommendation is that the Eiffel Tower should be one of, if not the last attraction that you guys go see.</div3>  
This is because if you start at the Eiffel tower, it will blow away your breath so much that everything else will feel unimpressive.
Leaving the Eiffel tower for last however, will allow y'all to enjoy everything Paris has to offer to the fullest.
Not just that, but leaving the Eiffel tower for last will still hit you all just as hard but will also be the last impression you guys will have of Paris once you leave.
That way you will always remember how Amazing Paris was many years later.</p>

<p>I will show you all some of the pictures that I took while in there. along with a link for those of you who are interested in traveling there soon.
    Make sure to not just visit the places listed in the site but also go find some of your own. While there I met some guys that recommended me a restaurant that was not on that list.
    It probably had the best food I've eaten this whole year. 
</p>

<p>I will be traveling to a some more countries this year, which I will not mention right now (It will a surprise for y'all!).
    It might be hard for those countries to compete with what I enjoyed in Paris, but I am hyped for them and would not be surprised if 
    I end up liking them even more than Paris. In any case,</p> <p><b>I would totally visit Paris again in the future!</b>.
